# Performing-ARCH-Model-on-Bitcoin-Closing-Prices

In this project, we analysis the adjusted closing price for BTC-CAD (Bitcoin prices in Canadian dollar) over a 5 year period. We want to model this data, to create an effective forecasting technique to predict the price of Bitcoin. Since we know that crypto currencies are quite unstable/volatile, we implment an ARCH prcoess to ovecome this obstactle.
